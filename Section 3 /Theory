Theory: Outline the steps to set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps for a Java application that includes building the code, running unit tests, and deploying to a staging environment.

#Steps to Setup CI/CD Pipeline in Azure devops:

There are two stages to create a CI/CD pipelines in Azure. First We need to create the build pipeline i.e. CI Pipeline
    1. Connect with the Source Control Manager like github, Azure repos, gitlab.
    2. We build the pipeline by adding multiple jobs in the yaml.
    3. After the pipeline will build, then it will create an artifact.

The second step is to run the pipeline i.e. CD Pipeline
   1. In this stage we simply deploy or we can simply say that we run the pipeline on multiple stages like dev, uat or prod.
