Theory: Outline the steps to set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps for a Java application that includes building the code, running unit tests, and deploying to a staging environment.

# Steps to Setup CI/CD Pipeline in Azure devops:

There are two stages to create a CI/CD pipelines in Azure. 

# CREATE BUILD PIPELINE:
Steps to Create a build pipeline:
1. Login to Azure devops with credentials.
2. Choose the Source Control Manager e.g. github
NOTE: You can also go for the classic editor.
3. From there you select the source, project, repository and branch of your github where your code will be placed.
4. Now you need to choose the task or we can simply say that job.
5. Select your agent specification.
6. Add a build task.
7. Add a test task.
8. Add a publish build task.
9. Click on save and run.

Check the build and test the result. In this way your build pieline will be created.
From here an artifact will be created.
